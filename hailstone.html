        <p>a hailstone sequence is a sequence of numbers generated by the following process:</p>
          <p>   if n is even, divide n by 2.</p>
          <p>   if n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1</p>
        <p>the collatz conjecture says that no matter which number you start with, you will eventually reach 1.
          what this sonification / visualization does is use the numbers of a hailstone sequence as the frequency of soundwaves.
          though each sequence will sound slightly different, each hailstone sequence possesses the same almost-harmonious, slightly eery sound.
          this is because dividing the frequency of a note by 2 lower that note by an octave, and multiplying a note by 3 raises that note by about an octave and a fifth.
          the additional +1 hz (as well as the fact that in a twelve-tone equal temperament system, an octave and a fifth is not exactly 3 times the frequency) leads to
          subtle shifts over time, most noticeable when the release time is high.
